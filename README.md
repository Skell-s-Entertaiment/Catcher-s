# Catcher's - A FNAF Fangame
_Catcher's is a video game based on the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, being developed in PenguinMod, a modified version of Scratch and Turbowarp. It seeks to maximize the engine's potential and implement fundamental optimization concepts. It aims to be a fun game, not a horror game._
# Synopsis
_It's your first night at "Tacos el Catcher" as a night guard. You'll have to complete the shift if you want to receive your pay or lose your apartment. Be careful, many secrets await you inside the place!_
# Technical Details
> _This is a list of some technical details about the story and planned development for Catcher's, some things may not match up in the future._
1. Catcher's uses the Gamejolt API to store player progress and, in turn, award and update platform trophies. In the event that the internet connection is not stable enough to keep the session open in the back-end, local storage is used within the cache of the browser running the project.

2. A pre-rendering and pre-loading system of assets required according to the context of the scene to be presented to the player is used, which allows for optimizing storage and vector rendering to the processor.

3. The programming orientation within Catcher's is clearly oriented towards the management of clones created in a specific order according to their use (this process is almost automatic).

4. PenguinMod and Turbowarp extensions are used, mostly from the SharkTools collection.

5. The game will be exported to .html and .exe (via Electron) and a DEMO can be played from GameJolt.

6. I'm considering implementing the same mechanism Miguel did, publishing fan art for the countdown to Catcher's release. It most likely won't be implemented, and if it were, it would only be for the full release and not the demo.

7. As I mentioned previously, I plan to allow downloading of an .html and an .exe [via electron (Chromium emulation that allows running JS, HTML, and CSS code natively on Windows.)]

8. Gameplay screenshots will of course be posted on both the GameJolt and Itch.io pages, but the emphasis will be on keeping the GameJolt page active by posting trailers, while only specific DevLogs will be posted on Itch.io.

9. Based on GameJolt's audience feedback and requests, there's a possibility of porting Catcher's to Android using a CloudGaming system linked to Itch.io, with the only requirement being an internet connection. I'll also investigate ways to do the port natively so as not to rely on "opening the HTML on the phone" or connecting to itch.io.
